# DestinationPredict.
Transforming Travel Experiences

## Project Overview
In the ever-expanding landscape of travel, the aim of this project is to revolutionize the industry by addressing a critical need for personalized recommendations. Traditional travel advisory services fall short in providing tailored experiences, leading to a lack of engagement among modern adventurers. Our project aims to fill this gap by deploying a data-driven solution that enhances user engagement and rejuvenates the travel sector. In order to increase engagement in the travel industry and increase excitement about travel opportunities, this is where DestinationPredict come in handy!

The DestinationPredict is a data product that allows future travelers to get a prediction for their perfect destination with the input of just a few words. Trained on over 28,000 unique text data points, the Destination Dictionary is able to predict a destination from 12 different popular cities with 81% accuracy based on text input of activities you want to do while on vacation.

## Scraping of the Data(Data Mining)
This project utilized data from 12 top cities from TripAdvisor's list of Traveler's Choice destinations for Popular World Destinations , which can be found at (https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Destinations). The dataset was compiled by scraping the titles from Tripadvisor 'attractions' for each of the 12 cities. The final dataset included over 28,000 unique text values.
